### Abstract
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is an almost 20 years old task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) which gained much attention especially thanks to past CoNLL and SemEval challenges. It is traditionally performed by exploiting verb inventories like PropBank or FrameNet in a monolingual or multilingual fashion on different corpora and in a span-based or dependency-based environment separately.
What we propose in this SemEval tasks are some major improvements to these classic settings, in fact, we provide a training set in English and parallel test and dev datasets in 6 languages annotated with both dependency- and span-based labels. Our aim is to spur participants in using transfer learning techniques to exploit knowledge from the English training set and apply it to other languages in order to perform both dependency- and span-based SRL. 
In doing so, they will use VerbAtlas, a novel multilingual verbal resource with explicit language-independent frame and role labels, whose labels have been used to annotate the whole dataset.
