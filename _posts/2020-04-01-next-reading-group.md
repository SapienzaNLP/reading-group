### Abstract
The rise of user-generated web content, due to the relative anonymity offered when posting online, has made the problem of abuse and hate detection concerningly prevalent. Moreover, this kind of psychological violence can occur at any time, making it even harder to protect potential victims. Despite the problem is far from being solved automatically, abuse detection systems can be used to alert and support human moderators. This presentation will give you an overview of the open problems in the field, together with a description of the most recent approaches.
