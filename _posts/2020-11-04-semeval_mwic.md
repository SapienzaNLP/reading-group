### Abstract
Over the course of the last years, we have been witnessing an increasing interest in the development and refinement of approaches for representing words and their meanings. Although potentially all approaches can be integrated and evaluated in downstream applications, the inherent ability of the various semantically-aware embeddings to capture meaning distinctions still remains largely under-investigated. While Word Sense Disambiguation has historically explored the aforementioned ability, the task does not make it easy to test approaches which are not explicitly linked to existing sense inventories such as WordNet. In the light of this, we propose a novel manually-annotated evaluation data set which drops the requirement of a fixed sense inventory and addresses crucial limitations of existing benchmarks, enabling multilingual and cross-lingual evaluation.
