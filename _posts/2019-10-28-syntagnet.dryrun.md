### Abstract
  
#### SyntagNet: Challenging Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation with Lexical-Semantic Combinations (Marco Maru, Federico Scozzafava, Federico Martelli and Roberto Navigli)
Current research in knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) indicates that performances depend 
heavily on the Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) employed. While LKBs tend to focus on the paradigmatic 
dimension of language, such resources fall short in respect of syntagmatic relations, which are also
crucial for sense disambiguation due to interconnecting co-occurring words. 
To address this deficiency, we present SyntagNet, a manually-curated large-scale lexical-semantic 
combination database which associates pairs of concepts with pairs of co-occurring words. 
By capturing sense distinctions evoked by syntagmatic relations, SyntagNet enables knowledge-based 
WSD systems to establish a new state of the art which challenges the hitherto unrivaled performances 
attained by supervised approaches.

See you there!
