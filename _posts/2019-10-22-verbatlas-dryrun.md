### Abstracts
#### VerbAtlas: a Novel Large-Scale Verbal Semantic Resource and Its Application to Semantic Role Labeling (Andrea Di Fabio, Simone Conia and Roberto Navigli)
We present VerbAtlas, a new, hand-crafted lexical-semantic resource whose goal 
is to bring together all verbal synsets from WordNet into semantically-coherent frames. 
The frames define a common, prototypical argument structure while at the same time providing 
new concept-specific information. In contrast to PropBank, which defines enumerative semantic roles, 
VerbAtlas comes with an explicit, cross-frame set of semantic roles linked to selectional preferences 
expressed in terms of WordNet synsets, and is the first resource enriched with semantic information
about implicit, shadow, and default arguments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of VerbAtlas in the task of dependency-based 
Semantic Role Labeling and show how its integration into a high-performance system 
leads to improvements on both the in-domain and out-of-domain test sets of CoNLL-2009.
