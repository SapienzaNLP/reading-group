### Abstracts
#### VerbAtlas: a Novel Large-Scale Verbal Semantic Resource and Its Application to Semantic Role Labeling (Andrea Di Fabio, Simone Conia and Roberto Navigli)
We present VerbAtlas, a new, hand-crafted lexical-semantic resource whose goal 
is to bring together all verbal synsets from WordNet into semantically-coherent frames. 
The frames define a common, prototypical argument structure while at the same time providing 
new concept-specific information. In contrast to PropBank, which defines enumerative semantic roles, 
VerbAtlas comes with an explicit, cross-frame set of semantic roles linked to selectional preferences 
expressed in terms of WordNet synsets, and is the first resource enriched with semantic information
about implicit, shadow, and default arguments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of VerbAtlas in the task of dependency-based 
Semantic Role Labeling and show how its integration into a high-performance system 
leads to improvements on both the in-domain and out-of-domain test sets of CoNLL-2009.
  
#### SyntagNet: Challenging Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation with Lexical-Semantic Combinations (Marco Maru, Federico Scozzafava, Federico Martelli and Roberto Navigli)
Current research in knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) indicates that performances depend 
heavily on the Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) employed. While LKBs tend to focus on the paradigmatic 
dimension of language, such resources fall short in respect of syntagmatic relations, which are also
crucial for sense disambiguation due to interconnecting co-occurring words. 
To address this deficiency, we present SyntagNet, a manually-curated large-scale lexical-semantic 
combination database which associates pairs of concepts with pairs of co-occurring words. 
By capturing sense distinctions evoked by syntagmatic relations, SyntagNet enables knowledge-based 
WSD systems to establish a new state of the art which challenges the hitherto unrivaled performances 
attained by supervised approaches.
