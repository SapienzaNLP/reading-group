### Abstract
With the “parameter race” between industrial giants fully underway and the media slowly starting to feed general public with inflated claims on AI closely tailing human intelligence, researchers are once more pointing out that the huge (and impressive) bulk of progress made in Natural Language Processing has little or nothing to do with actual natural language, nor with its primary functions. 
Are we staring at a dazzling flash in the pan? Or are we reaching necessary milestones on what feels like a long way ahead?
In this brief talk, aided by recent position papers, we (i) aim to offer a bird’s eye view on the issues entailed by inappropriately using terms such as “comprehension”, “understanding” and “meaning” in NLP, and (ii) try to trace a line to place us where we are, and to posit what we are lacking before reaching the sought-after objective of “Natural Language Understanding.”
