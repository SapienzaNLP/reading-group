### Abstract
Multi-task learning is often used to improve generality and performance on closely related tasks. Current pre-trained language models are jointly trained on tasks such as MLM and Next Sentence Prediction. However multi-task training is often unexplored on downstream tasks outside of GLUE. We will talk about joint models of metaphor, emotion, political rhetoric and populist attitude and how auxiliary tasks can help these models perform better. Moreover, since populist attitude is an unexplored area within NLP, we will discuss an annotation procedure in order to obtain a dataset that leverages emotions in order to enable multi-task learning, as well as the insights that can be obtained from such dataset.
