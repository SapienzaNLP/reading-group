### Abstract
The data labeling process is often time-consuming and very expensive, and this makes it reserved for those institutions that can afford it. But do we really need manually tagged data?

In recent years, interest in unsupervised data generation techniques has been growing; besides, the increase in computational capacity has made it possible to propose ever larger neural models, which compensate for the noisy nature of such data.

In this presentation are included some insights on how to automatically generate labeled data in an unsupervised fashion. Special attention is dedicated to the Extractive Question Answering datasets; in particular, we will describe i) a technique for the generation of question-context-answer tuples from raw text and ii) an approach to decompose hard questions in simpler sub-questions that can be easily answered by an off-the-shelf QA model; such results are then combined into a final answer to the original hard question.
