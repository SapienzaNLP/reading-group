### Abstract
Nowadays Representation Learning (and Deep Learning!) models tend to have a few issues, such as data inefficiency, poor generalisation to out-of-distribution data, and lack of interpretability. We propose two ways to sort these out - by incorporating background knowledge via regularisation, and by combining symbolic and neural computation models.
