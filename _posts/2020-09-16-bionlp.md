### Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has always played an important role in Biology and 
Medicine, especially in extracting relevant information from the ever-growing literature.
While high-quality biomedical information extraction is critical for the times we live 
in, recently proposed NLP techniques have enabled much more than that. This brief talk 
will provide an overview on the application of recent NLP techniques to a variety of 
biomedical tasks, from traditional text mining and analysis, to clinical and basic 
research.
