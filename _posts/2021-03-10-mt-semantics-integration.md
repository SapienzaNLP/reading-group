### Abstract
Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most challenging tasks in NLP, and with the appearance of deep neural network models, MT has incremented considerably translation performances. Intuitively, semantic representations can be very useful for MT, enforcing meaning preservation and handling data sparsity. However, there is not so much work done on leveraging semantics for Neural MT. This presentation will show the latest research done on incorporating AMR and UCCA structures into Neural MT, showing how these semantic structures can be integrated and their advantages.
