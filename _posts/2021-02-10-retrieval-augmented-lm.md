### Abstract
Pre-trained language models such as GPT and BERT have significantly advanced the state of art in a wide range of NLP tasks. Besides containing syntactic and semantic information, these models have demonstrated to store also factual knowledge in their parameters. Starting from this evidence, different techniques to extract world knowledge from LMs have been proposed. However, the ability to access knowledge in these models is still limited and not appropriate for knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering. To overcome these limitations and to capture knowledge more directly, language models equipped with a dedicated knowledge retriever component have been introduced. REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training) is one of them and will be the central focus of this presentation.
